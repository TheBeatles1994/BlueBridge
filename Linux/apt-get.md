# apt-get(Advanced Packaging Tool)

>> a command-line tool which Ubuntu uses to install, remove, and manage software packages

1. apt-get update updates the list of available packages and their versions, but it does not install or upgrade any packages.
2. apt-get **upgrade** actually installs newer versions of the packages you have. After updating the lists, the package manager knows about available updates for the software you have installed. This is why you first want to update.
